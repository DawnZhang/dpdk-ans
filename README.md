#### TCP/IP stack for dpdk
--------------
ANS(accelerated network stack) is DPDK native TCP/IP stack and also refer to [FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) implementation. ANS provides a userspace TCP/IP stack for use with the Intel [DPDK](http://dpdk.org/). 

--------------
![](/doc/design/ans_code.png)
- ans: accelerated network stack process.
 
- librte_ans: TCP/IP stack static library. ANS use dpdk mbuf, ring, memzone, mempool, timer, spinlock. so zero copy mbuf between dpdk and ANS. 

- librte_anssock: ANS socket lib for application, zero copy between ANS and application.

- librte_anscli: ANS cli lib for route/ip/neigh/link configuration.

- cli: Command for configure ANS tcp/ip stack.

- example: ANS application example.
 
- test: Example application with ANS for testing ANS tcp/ip stack

         |                  NIC + RSS            | 
         |---------------------------------------| 
```
 - NIC distribute packets to different lcore based on RSS, so same TCP flow are handled in the same lcore.
 - Each lcore has own TCP stack, free lock.
 - IP/ARP/ICMP are shared between lcores.
 - APP process runs as a tcp server.
    - If App process only creates one listen socket, the listen socket only listens on one lcore and accept tcp connections from the lcore, so the APP process number shall large than the lcore number. The listen sockets of APP processes are created on each lcore averagely. For example: ans(with -c 0x3) run on two lcore, shall run two nginx(only run master ), one nginx listens on lcore0, another nginx listens on lcore1.
 - APP process can bind the same port if enable reuseport, APP process could accept tcp connection by round robin.
 - If NIC don't support multi queue or RSS, shall enhance ans_main.c, reserve one lcore to receive and send packets from NIC, and distribute packets to lcores of ANS tcp stack by software RSS.

#### [Wiki Page](https://github.com/ansyun/dpdk-ans/wiki)
-------
You can get more information and instructions from [wiki page](https://github.com/ansyun/dpdk-ans/wiki).

#### Notes
-------
- You shall use the same dpdk version as ans libs used.
- Shall use the same gcc version to compile your application.
- ANS socket application run as a secondary dpdk process, If you got below log, shall execute below commands to disable ASLR.
```
EAL: WARNING: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is enabled in the kernel.
EAL: This may cause issues with mapping memory into secondary processes
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
```
- You shall modify the NIC configuration in ans_main.c based on your NIC type.
- ANS didn't support loopback interface, so socket client and server can't be in the same ANS tcp/ip stack.
- In order to improve ANS performance, you shall isolate ANS'lcore from kernel by isolcpus and isolcate interrupt from ANS's lcore by update /proc/irq/default_smp_affinity file.
- ANS run as dpdk primary process, when startup ANS, shall stop other secondary processes(nginx/redis/http_server).
- Don't run ANS on lcore0, it will effect ANS performance.

- You shall include dpdk libs as below way because mempool lib has __attribute__((constructor, used)) in latest version, otherwise your application would coredump.
```
  -$(RTE_ANS)/librte_anssock/librte_anssock.a \
  -L$(RTE_SDK)/$(RTE_TARGET)/lib \
  -Wl,--whole-archive -Wl,-lrte_mbuf -Wl,-lrte_mempool_ring -Wl,-lrte_mempool -Wl,-lrte_ring -Wl,-lrte_eal -Wl,--no-whole-archive -Wl,-export-dynamic -lnuma \
